# Introduction

Welcome to the workshop *Intro to HPC for Deep Learning* ðŸ‘‹.

This workshop is designed to help deep learning practitioners get started on [NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)'s high performance computing platform.

We won't be teaching how to do the cool bleeding-edge deep learning, but we will answer existential questions such as "How do I get package X to find the GPU Y and run with CUDA version Z ðŸ˜±?".

The following topics will be covered:

- [Installation](install.md): use preinstalled deep learning packages or install it yourself,
- [Batch jobs](submit.md): submit a batch job using a GPU and make sure to use it,
- [Monitoring](monitor.md): track progression of model training and GPU usage.

During this workshop, we will be using the [Jupyter-on-NeSI](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz) service.
Let's now head to the [Workshop Setup](setup.md) section to get started on the platform.
